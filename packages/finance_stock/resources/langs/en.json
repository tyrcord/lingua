However, due to prevailing market conditions and the limited availability of sellers, the order ends up being executed at a slightly higher price of $101 per share. In such a scenario, the slippage would amount to 1% ([$101 - $100] / $100 * 100%). Therefore, if you anticipate a 1% slippage when entering the market, please enter the value 1",
