        "example": "Let's suppose you intend to enter the market by placing a stop order to buy a stock at $100 per share. However, due to prevailing market conditions and the limited availability of sellers, the order ends up being executed at a slightly higher price of $101 per share. In such a scenario, the slippage would amount to 1% ([$101 - $100] / $100 * 100%). Therefore, if you anticipate a 1% slippage when entering the market, please enter the value 1",

It is common for orders placed with stop orders or stop losses to not be executed at the exact indicated price. Slippage, expressed as a percentage, considers the potential deviations that can occur for both your entry and exit prices."
